# An example of OCR for Fitz Digital Team

This repository contains code, data and a ipynb to explain how to use Tesseract's OCR to derive text from a combined PDF file to 
individual page examples as a demo for documentation colleagues.

To use at the command line:

```
$ python3 splitPdf.py -p . -f 1975_1989.pdf -d processed -n 1975_1989_processed -o ocr
```
